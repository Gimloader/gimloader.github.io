The best way to learn how to make scripts is to look through ones that already exist. I suggest checking out the [official plugins](https://github.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader/tree/main/plugins) for some inspiration. You can also look through the [docs](../api/scopedapi) to get more familiar with the api.

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord at `@thelazysquid` if you have any questions, and good luck out there.

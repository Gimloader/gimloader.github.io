title: PhysicsSettings
description: A Gimloader plugin that lets you change your physics
---

import ButtonInstall from '../../../components/ButtonInstall.svelte';

PhysicsSettings allows you to tweak a few things about the physics in platformer modes. Currently it allows you to change your jump height, the number of jumps you have, and your move speed on the ground. This is only client side, others will not see your altered physics.

description: A Gimloader plugin that lets you create tool-assisted runs of Don't Look Down
---

import ButtonInstall from '../../../components/ButtonInstall.svelte';

DLDTAS allows you to make tool-assisted speedruns of [Don't Look Down](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Down). You can pick which inputs your character performs each frame, and step forwards and backwards frames to make extremely optimized runs. Check out Horse's sub 3:30 TAS [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id8OSRNOygk) to see what this can look like in action. You can also pair this with the [BringBackBoosts](/Gimloader/plugins/bringbackboosts) plugin to get much faster results.

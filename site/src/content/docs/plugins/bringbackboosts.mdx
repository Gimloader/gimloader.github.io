description: A Gimloader plugin that restores the removed boosts bug

import ButtonInstall from '../../../components/ButtonInstall.svelte';

BringBackBoosts restores a patched bug which allows players to gain large amounts of speed in platformer modes by hitting corners in a precise way. This only happens client-side, others will not see you with this speed. You can also enable "Use Release Physics" in settings to adjust the physics to be similar to how it was upon the release of platforming.

# gimloader.github.io

This is the the official site for [Gimloader](https://github.com/Gimloader/Gimloader), which offers usage instructions, a list of plugins, api docs, and more.

## Development

To run the site locally:

1. Make sure you have [bun](https://bun.sh/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
2. Clone this repo somewhere and cd into it
3. Run `bun install`
4. Run `bun run dev`, and open up the site at http://localhost:4321

Note that the plugin install buttons will say "Gimloader extension not found", since Gimloader is only configured to work on `gimloader.github.io` by default.

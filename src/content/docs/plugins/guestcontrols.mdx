import ButtonInstall from "$components/install/ButtonInstall.svelte";

GuestControls gives guests of rooms in 2d gamemodes the ability to do the following:
- End the game
- Restore the game ("Back To Lobby" button)
- Add game time (clicking on the timer)
- Kick players

Due to limitations of Gimkit, guests cannot do anything in the lobby, such as starting the game or configuring teams.

This of course requires the host of the game to also have GuestControls enabled - if the host does not have it enabled, you won't see any extra controls in the top-bar during the game.

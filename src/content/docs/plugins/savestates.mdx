title: Savestates
description: A Gimloader plugin that lets you save and load where you are

import ButtonInstall from '../../../components/ButtonInstall.svelte';

With Savestates you can save your location and speed in [Don't Look Down](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Down) by hitting a hotkey (Alt + Comma by default). You can then load that state with another hotkey (Alt + Period by default). Savestates also adds hotkeys to teleport to the various summits. Ctrl + Alt + 1 for summit 1, Ctrl + Alt + 2 for summit 2, etc. This only happens client-side, others will not see you teleport.

CustomUI allows you to change a few small things about the Gimkit UI. Most importantly, it allows you to use a theme for the question answerer in [2D Gamemodes](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Gamemodes#2D_Gamemodes), where this would normally be impossible. You can use any of the [default Gimkit themes](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Tycoon#Themes) or make your own. You can also pick the opacity of the question answering screen. Additionally, you can make it so that the purple bar on the top of the screen goes away unless you are hovering over it.

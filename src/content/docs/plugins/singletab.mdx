Gimkit normally opens a new tab when you create a new game, which may be cumbersome. This plugin will open the games in the current tab instead of a new one.

<ButtonInstall client:only="svelte" name="SingleTab" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/build/plugins/SingleTab.js" />

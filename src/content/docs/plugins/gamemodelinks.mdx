import ButtonInstall from "$components/install/ButtonInstall.svelte";

When gamemode links in the gimkit.com/gamemode path are entered, GamemodeLinks will attempt to create a new game room from the settings provided. To get started, just click through the available 2d maps like you normally do, and the link in your browser should change based on the map and settings you select. You can then bookmark the link with your browser, and click it any time you want to quickly make a new room.

1D Maps are not supported yet.

## Links

Links are in the following format: `/gamemode/[map id]?[options]`

All options are optional, because every option has a default value. That will be overridden by the settings you've entered into Gimkit in the past, and those will be overridden by the options provided. If you enter something that isn't an option, it will be ignored.

Just play around in the map selector options to the find options you want.

2dMovementTAS allows you to make tool-assisted speedruns for [Capture The Flag](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Capture_The_Flag) and [Tag](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Tag:_Domination). Each frame, you can select which angle you are moving at, whether you are answering questions, and whether you are purchasing things. You can advance forwards and backwards in time to create extremely optimized runs. You can also drag the arrow on the right side of the UI to copy the angle from one frame to others.

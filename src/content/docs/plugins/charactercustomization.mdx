CharacterCustomization lets you use any gim or trail you want to client-side (others will not see it). To use an existing gim or trail you will need to enter its id, which can be found on the [Wiki](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Gimkit_Wiki) (click [here](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Gims) for gims and [here](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Trails) for trails). Additionally, you can create and upload a custom gim. Head to the [GimCreator](/utilities/gim-creator/) page to easily make them, or download the pre-made Josh gim [here](https://github.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/blob/main/plugins/CharacterCustomization/skins/joshGim.png).

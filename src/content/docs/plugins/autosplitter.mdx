import ButtonInstall from "$components/ButtonInstall.svelte";

Autosplitter allows you to easily time speedruns of [Don't Look Down](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Down), [Fishtopia](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/Fishtopia), and [One Way Out](https://gimkit.wiki/wiki/One_Way_Out). Don't Look Down can be configured to be either the whole game or a single summit, as well as letting you pick between which physics version you are using. The One Way Out timer will also show your keycard drop rate at the top left of the timer.

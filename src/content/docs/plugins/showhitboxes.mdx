description: A Gimloader plugin that lets you see your hitbox

import ButtonInstall from "$components/ButtonInstall.svelte";

ShowHitboxes enables Gimkit's built-in debug mode, which shows you various things: your hitbox, your velocity, and the hitboxes of static objects. This cannot be activated mid-game, you will need to reload. Also, this debug mode is unfortunately very laggy- your game may run up to seven times slower depending on the map and your computer.

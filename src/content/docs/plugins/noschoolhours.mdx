On student accounts, the discovery page will disallow you from using the creative discovery page during school hours. NoSchoolHours bypasses this restriction.

<ButtonInstall client:only="svelte" name="NoSchoolHours" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/build/plugins/NoSchoolHours.js" />

<DesyncWarning />

Desynchronize prevents the server from snapping your player back, either due to plugins messing with its location or due to lag. Others will not be able to see you move, and most gamemodes will not work properly. The one exception to this is Don't Look Down, which has its logic re-implemented to accomodate speedrunning.

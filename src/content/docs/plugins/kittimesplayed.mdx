import ButtonInstall from "$components/install/ButtonInstall.svelte";

For each kit in the list of your kits, KitTimesPlayed will add text of how many times the kit has been played right next to when the kit was created.

<ButtonInstall client:only="svelte" name="KitTimesPlayed" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/build/plugins/KitTimesPlayed.js" />

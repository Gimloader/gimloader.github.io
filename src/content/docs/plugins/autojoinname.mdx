import ButtonInstall from "$components/install/ButtonInstall.svelte";

AutoJoinName skips the step of having to enter a name in when joining games, by instantly joining the game with the name you entered in the plugin settings. The name cannot be empty or longer than 20 characters.

<ButtonInstall client:only="svelte" name="AutoJoinName" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/build/plugins/AutoJoinName.js" />

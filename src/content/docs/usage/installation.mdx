<Steps>
1. Install the Gimloader extension for your browser. If you use a Chromium browser such as Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc get it from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gimloader/ngbhofnofkggjbpkpnogcdfdgjkpmgka), and if you use Firefox get it from [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gimloader/).

2. Confirm it's working by going to [gimkit.com/join](https://www.gimkit.com/join). There should be a wrench icon next to the join button.
